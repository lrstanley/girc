~~girc is fairly close to marking the 1.0.0 endpoint, which will be tagged as
necessary, so you will be able to use this with care knowing the specific tag
you're using won't have breaking changes~~

## Features

- Focuses on ~~simplicity~~  Ä·¥Ä…™…¥…™…¥…¢  ú·¥á ü ü“ì…™ Ä·¥á, yet tries to still be flexible.
- Only requires [standard library packages](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic?imports)
- Event based triggering/responses ([example](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic#ex-package--Commands), and [CTCP too](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic#Commands.SendCTCP)!)
- [Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic) is _mostly_ complete.
- Support for almost all of the [IRCv3 spec](http://ircv3.net/software/libraries.html).
  - SASL Auth (currently only `PLAIN` and `EXTERNAL` is support by default,
  however you can simply implement `SASLMech` yourself to support additional
  mechanisms.)
  - Message tags (things like `account-tag` on by default)
  - `account-notify`, `away-notify`, `chghost`, `extended-join`, etc -- all handled seemlessly ([cap.go](https://github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic/blob/master/cap.go) for more info).
- Channel and user tracking. Easily find what users are in a channel, if a
  user is away, or if they are authenticated (if the server supports it!)
- Client state/capability tracking. Easy methods to access capability data ([LookupChannel](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic#Client.LookupChannel), [LookupUser](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic#Client.LookupUser), [GetServerOption (ISUPPORT)](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic#Client.GetServerOption), etc.)
- Built-in support for things you would commonly have to implement yourself.
  - Nick collision detection and prevention (also see [Config.HandleNickCollide](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic#Config).)
  - Event/message rate limiting.
  - Channel, nick, and user validation methods ([IsValidChannel](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic#IsValidChannel), [IsValidNick](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic#IsValidNick), etc.)
  - CTCP handling and auto-responses ([CTCP](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic#CTCP))
  - ~~And more!~~  
  - GOTTA GO FAST YOU GOTTA GO REALLY FAST
  - you can power hundreds of clients at the same time with this now

## Installing

  ~~$ go get -u github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic~~  
  just use go modules probably

## Examples

See [the examples](https://godoc.org/github.com/yunginnanet/girc-atomic#example-package--Bare)
within the documentation for real-world usecases. Here are a few real-world
usecases/examples/projects which utilize the real girc:

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [nagios-check-ircd](https://github.com/lrstanley/nagios-check-ircd) | Nagios utility for monitoring the health of an ircd |
| [nagios-notify-irc](https://github.com/lrstanley/nagios-notify-irc) | Nagios utility for sending alerts to one or many channels/networks |
| [matterbridge](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge) | bridge between mattermost, IRC, slack, discord (and many others) with REST API |
